Phase 1 ‚Äî Foundations (Beginner Python + MVP)
Goal: Learn Python basics + build a working phishing detector script.

‚úÖ Understand input/output in Python
‚úÖ Write your first function to analyze URLs or email text
‚úÖ Implement rules-based detection:
Suspicious keywords (login, update, bonus, etc.)
Common phishing TLDs (.ru, .cn, .tk, etc.)
Typosquatted brand names (paypai.com, amaz0n.net)
‚úÖ Output verdict: ‚ÄúSafe / Suspicious / Dangerous‚Äù with reasons
Deliverable:
A Python terminal program (phishguardian.py) that runs simple checks on user input.

Phase 2 ‚Äî Muscle Upgrade (Regex + APIs + Real Intelligence)
Goal: Move from rules to smarter, real-world detection.

Learn regex to catch:
IP addresses as domains
Hidden unicode/punycode tricks
Obfuscated formats
Use Python libraries like urllib, tldextract, whois to parse and validate URLs
Integrate security threat feeds / APIs (e.g. VirusTotal, PhishTank)
Add scoring based on threat reputation
Deliverable:
Terminal app that flags phishing links using live intelligence + rules.

Phase 3 ‚Äî Accessibility Boost (GUI / Web App)
Goal: Make PhishGuardian usable by anyone, not just developers.

Build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using tkinter (desktop app)
OR build a Flask web app (browser-accessible tool)
Add input box for pasting links/messages
Show output verdicts with color-coded results
Explain risks in plain language (e.g. ‚ÄúThis domain uses .ru, often linked to scams‚Äù)
Deliverable:
A mini‚Äëproduct, easy to demo and share with classmates, teachers, and non‚Äëtech users.

Phase 4 ‚Äî AI Engine (Recognition Stage)
Goal: Inject machine learning + natural language processing.

Collect datasets of phishing vs. safe URLs/emails (Kaggle, PhishTank, OpenPhish)
Build a baseline text classifier with scikit-learn
Upgrade to modern NLP models (e.g. HuggingFace Transformers)
Add OCR (pytesseract) to scan image-based phishing (e.g. fake login screenshots)
Deliverable:
An AI‚Äëpowered phishing assistant that can classify suspicious text and explain why.

Phase 5 ‚Äî Future Growth (Research / Recognition)
Goal: Transform into something unique & recognized.

Add Explainable AI (XAI) so users see why the model flagged phishing
Package as a browser extension to auto‚Äëscan URLs before clicking
Publish the repo as an open-source project to build recognition
Possibly write a research blog/paper on ‚ÄúAI for Phishing Detection‚Äù
Deliverable:
Something that looks like a real research project or even an early startup tool, not just a student assignment.

üéØ TL;DR Evolution Path
Phase 1: Rules checker (Python CLI)
Phase 2: Real data feeds + regex (smarter detection)
Phase 3: Web/GUI (user-friendly tool)
Phase 4: AI/NLP classifier (intelligent phishing detection)
Phase 5: Browser extension + research credibility
